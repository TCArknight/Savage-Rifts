  <!-- Standard character sheet
        This is the default character sheet for any actor, consisting of two pages.
        The first page includes all the core information for the character and will
        usually be all that is needed. The second page provides a place for any info
        that didn't fit on the first page to be output (e.g. too many weapons). The
        sheet contents are defined in the files "sheet_standard1.dat" and
        "sheet_standard2.dat".

        This dossier allows the user to output everything associated with the

        and the journal output into the single dossier.
