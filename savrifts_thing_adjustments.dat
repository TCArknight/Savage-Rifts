<!-- This file contains the assortment of adjustments that can be applied to actors
      for the game system. The behaviors of adjustments are varied and configured via
      the assignment of tags. Additionally, many adjustments can target a type of trait
      that the user can select, so fields are used to constrain the valid options. The
      actual net effect of each adjustment is applied via the script associated with
      the adjustment. All of these scripts are applied at a timing of Setup/8000 to
      ensure that they occur at an appropriate point in the overall evaluation cycle.

      The visual behavior of each adjustment is controlled via the various "AdjustShow"
      tags that are assigned, such as whether to show an incrementer and/or a menu for
      user selection. The "Helper.UserAdjust" tag is used to identify an adjustment
      that is controllable by the user. Suitable "InPlay" tags are assigned to control
      whether an adjustment can be permanent or temporary, governing where the actual
      adjustment appears for selection and how its effects are applied.
